# android_pin_appwidget_example
Example app for the pinning an Android app-widget to the homescreen feature (which is not used a lot).

By default the launcher presents a pop-up with 2 options:
1. Drag-'n-drop the widget to the homescreen
2. Tap "Add to homescreen" (/"Add"/text may vary) button which automagically adds the widget to any of the homescreen pages (location logic differs per launcher).


I've spotted that several launchers don't actually support both options they present. On the one launcher the drag-'n-drop is there but doesn't really drop the widget on the homescreen. On the other launchers the add button is there but doesn't work.

This example app is the MVP app to show that and to test on different launchers.

See the video's in '/Cases' folder for some examples.
